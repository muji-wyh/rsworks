Hello, my name is wangyaohui, I am from HeBei province. After graduating, I have been working as a front-end developer
and I write nodejs too. I love front end development, and I think it's a greet job deserved to persist to do

I went to a compony named anjuke after I was graduated, it's my first work, doing front end development,
at that time, I use javascript and jQuery and plain css and even flash, and I did a lot
of works to let my code run expectly in almost browsers, includes ie6. At that time I meet the react and webpack
toolchain first time, and I developed a HTML5 app use react

And after that, I came to BeiJing's 58 company, using vue technology, the pages which you use
to publish your things you do not need any more in the 58 app is almost all
developed by my, and I was the main owner of that refectory job
